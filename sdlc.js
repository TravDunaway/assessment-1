// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.

1. Planning
2. Analysis of Requirements
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing & Integration
6. Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/

let Planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
let Analysis of Requirements = "This allows for things such as cost analysis, risk analysis and overall feasibility"
let Design = "This portion of the cycle lets all stakeholders determine the specific directionalities of the project."
let Implementation = "This stage allows for actual development, i.g. following the agreed upon design blueprint designated during stage "/design"/"
let Testing - Integration = "Once implementation hits a certain point, a testing stage is executed which allows time for the varifying of current implementation, i.e. debugging. Also during this stage, those portions of code that are funtioning as per their design specification can be implemented."
let Maintain = "Once the coding process is implemented, constant maintainance is necessary in order for the designed code to function as specified.
